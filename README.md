# SnakeWaterGunGame
It is a terminal window based game in python.I have used random module to generate randomness.I have used list and through list I have picked up snake,water,gun with the help of
funtion random.choice().
Finally by using if statements I have checked condtions and according to that game result is declared on terminal screen.
